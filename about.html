This application is designed by Soumyadip Basak. This web application helps the user to know about different 
weather elements(like the temperature, wind speed, humidity, sunrise location,etc) of the city the user searches for.

When we load the application by default, the application gives the weather updates of Delhi, India. The bottom section
gives updates about other four cities namely - Mumbai, Chennai, Agartala, Bhubaneswar. We can search for our desired city using 
the Search Bar at the top-right corner of the application.

Hope you enjoy using this application.
